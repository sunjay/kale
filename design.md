# design notes

- [ ] Straight lines
- [ ] Arcs
- [ ] Circles
- [ ] Filled version of a shape made from any of the above (single fill color)
- [ ] Border of filled shape may change its drawing properties at any point along the path
- [ ] Text
- [ ] Images (stamps?)
- [ ] Multiple turtles
- [ ] Undo/Redo

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut turtle = Turtle::new();

  turtle.set_pen_size(5.0);
  turtle.set_pen_color(color::RED);
  turtle.set_fill_color(color::CYAN);

  turtle.begin_fill();
  turtle.forward(10.0);
  turtle.right(10.0);

  // Change of pen halfway through, still filling
  turtle.set_pen_color(color::BLUE);
  turtle.forward(10.0);
  // counterclockwise
  turtle.arc(
    10.0, // radius left of the turtle
    30.0, // degrees of the circle to draw
  );
}
```

Rules:

* Pen down when turtle is created
* Pen down => line is capped at start
* Pen up => line is capped at end
* Otherwise => line is not capped at the end
* Pen down then pen up => line is not capped at the end

```rust
struct Pen {
  pub enabled: bool,
  pub color: Color,
  pub stroke: StrokeOptions,
}

impl Default for Pen {
  fn default() -> Self {
    Self {
      enabled: true,
      color: color::BLACK,
      stroke: StrokeOptions {
        start_cap: LineCap::Round,
        line_width: 1.0,
        ..StrokeOptions::default()
      },
    }
  }
}

struct Turtle {
  /// The current path animated by the turtle
  animated_path: Path,
}

impl Turtle {
  pub fn new() -> Self {
    Self {
    }
  }
}
```

## Multiple Turtles

Multiple turtles need to have the right drawing order. How does overlap work?

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut drawing = turtle::Drawing::new();

  let turtle1 = drawing.add_turtle();
  let turtle2 = drawing.add_turtle();

  turtle1.set_pen_color(color::RED);
  turtle1.pen_up();
  // bottom left corner
  turtle1.go_to(-10.0, -10.0);
  // turn towards top right
  turtle1.right(45.0);
  turtle2.pen_down();

  turtle1.set_pen_color(color::BLUE);
  turtle2.pen_up();
  // bottom right corner
  turtle2.go_to(10.0, -10.0);
  // turn towards top left
  turtle2.left(45.0);
  turtle2.pen_down();

  // Draw towards each other
  turtle1.forward(100.0);
  turtle2.forward(100.0);
}
```

As the turtle lines overlap and move past each other, how should the red and
blue lines overlap? If we just use the "first come first serve" rule, they will
alternate the overlap back and forth (which would look quite odd). Once we
decide on an overlap order, it shouldn't change. Furthermore, the overlap order
should be decided based on which line reaches the overlap point(s) first, not
just which line is first. That means that there can be multiple (!!!) overlap
points with different behaviours.

## Time

An interesting way to do this would be to exploit the depth buffer in order to
create some notion of time. Instead of starting from `(x1, y1)` and going to
`(x2, y2)`, we would use `(x1, y1, t1)` and `(x2, y2, t2)`. The `t` values would
be what we put into the depth buffer.

We'll use whatever the smallest floating point increment is (e.g. `1e-6` or
whatever). And we can reset `t1` to `0` every time no one is animating anymore.
Just in case, we'll use wrapping arithmetic so there is never any panicking.

The depth buffer is populated from the `z` coordinates of the point returned
from the vertex shader. We would just have to be careful that this isn't
accidentally used in any actual shader calculations or we'll end up with some
incorrect renders.
