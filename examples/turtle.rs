//! A simplified version of the turtle crate designed to test out the renderer in order to make
//! sure that it meets the needs of the turtle crate.
//!
//! The renderer is designed to only re-render as much as it needs to. This is in contrast to the
//! original naive renderer which always re-rendered all of the drawing commands every frame.
